![dev's roadmap](/static/roadmap.png 'to do roadmap')

this is another simple chatbot made with the llama3.1 model. a very simple, easy-to-navigate UI, with a lot of plans for expansion for future projects. check out the demo website live now [here!](https://hs-chatbot.vercel.app)

## TODO

- deploy this to EC2 (because I am not in the US at the time of commit, I am unable to verify my number for EC2 publishing)
- integrate some sort of backend instead of relying on Svelte API routes
- have Postgres and Pinecone for fetching and routing
